To enhance the infrastructure, the following components can be added, along with their purposes:

Additional Server:

Purpose: Provides scalability and redundancy. Adding another server ensures that resources like CPU and RAM are not overloaded by increasing traffic and supports fault tolerance.
HAProxy Load Balancer in Cluster Mode:

Purpose: A load balancer like HAProxy distributes incoming traffic across multiple servers, preventing any single server from becoming a bottleneck. Setting it up in cluster mode enhances availability by ensuring that even if one HAProxy instance fails, traffic is rerouted seamlessly through another instance.
Benefit: It provides both load distribution and high availability, critical for large-scale applications.
Separate Servers for Web Server, Application Server, and Database:

Purpose: Decoupling these components improves performance, scalability, and manageability. Each component can be scaled independently based on demand.
Web Server: Handles HTTP requests, static content, and caching (e.g., NGINX or Apache).
Application Server: Executes business logic and generates dynamic content (e.g., using Java or Python-based frameworks).
Database Server: Manages persistent data storage with optimized I/O and transaction handling.
Specific Advantages of This Setup
Scalability: Adding more servers allows the system to handle more users or requests.
Resilience: Clustering and separating components reduce the risk of a single point of failure.
Efficiency: Specialized servers optimize their specific workloads (e.g., web servers for static content, application servers for logic).
Flexibility: Updating or upgrading one component without affecting others simplifies maintenance.
This infrastructure design ensures a balanced and robust architecture that aligns with best practices in modern web application deployment【11】【12】.
